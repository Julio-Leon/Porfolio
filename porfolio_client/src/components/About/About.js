            <p className='about'>Welcome to my Porfolio, My name is Julio Leon, I am 19 years old and I live in New York. I am a young software developer that loves to learn and looks foward to getting my first job on the field. I know that sometimes it may be hard to trust new developers, but every single one of us are looking for that one person who wants to take that leap of faith for us. With that being said, I hope you like the content.</p>
