                <p className='about'>Welcome to my Porfolio, My name is Julio Leon, I am 19 years old and I live in New York. I am a young software developer that loves to learn and looks foward to getting my first job on the field. I know that sometimes it might be hard to trust new developers, but every single one of us is looking for that one person who wants to take that leap of faith in us. Well with that set, have a look. Thanks for your time.</p>
